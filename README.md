# Sorting_Algorithm_Visulizer

This project sorting algorithm visualizer is a very simple UI which allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and control the speed of the visualization. The problem Sorting Visualizer solves. Created a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work.

Colors:

1.  Red. Red color indicates the initial stage of the array which is not sorted.
2.  Blue. Blue color is the sign of swapping of the values.
3.  Green. Green color is the final stage of the sorting process. It indicates that array is sorted.
